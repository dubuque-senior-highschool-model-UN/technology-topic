What should be the U.S. position in the United Nations on developing sustainable smart cities? 


Background Information:

The United Nations (UN) is actively promoting smart and sustainable cities through various initiatives aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. These efforts aim to ensure urbanization contributes to sustainable development and improves the quality of life in cities worldwide by 2030. Key goals include improving environmental impact, infrastructure, housing, and transportation.
Another significant initiative is United for Smart Sustainable Cities (U4SSC), coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), and UN-Habitat. U4SSC offers guidelines and frameworks to help cities become smarter and more sustainable, emphasizing technology’s role in improving urban living and promoting environmental sustainability.
UN-Habitat advances smart cities through its International Guidelines on People-Centered Smart Cities, advocating for inclusive, participatory development that benefits all citizens, especially marginalized groups.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) contributes by establishing the Smart Cities and Digital Governance Centre, which supports governments in using technology to improve urban governance, service delivery, and citizen engagement. The UNDP provides technical assistance, policy guidance, and capacity-building programs to help cities implement smart solutions tailored to local contexts.
Through these initiatives, the UN has created an amazing framework for promoting smart, sustainable cities, focusing on inclusivity, resilience, and environmental sustainability. By fostering collaboration among governments, private sector partners, and civil society, the UN plays a pivotal role in shaping the cities of the future.

United States Position:
1. The US is trying to move in the direction of smart cities. It increases quality of life for US citizens and is a way to improve sustainability and urban efficiency. Larger cities in the US, such New York, San Francisco, and Austin, have already started moving towards smart city initiatives. These cities have implemented self-driving vehicles, smart grids, and technology based spacial planning in urban areas. Major tech companies based in the US have deeply immersed themselves in the concept of smart cities. They see them to grow America in a more sustainable way. These smart cities improve infrastructure in urban areas and minimize excess waste. The economy is also largely benefitted by the birth of smart cities. These cities improve efficiency in many ways as previously stated. waste management improves immensely, efficient transportation, as well as energy sources. These emerging smart cities tend to attract big money investment and businesses. An example that is already implemented in the US is Silicon Valley, which is a well-known hub for technology and innovation.

2.However, the US recognizes the dangers of smart cities as they are exclusive, favoring the wealthy as technological advancements are extremely costly. Though the cost argument is approaching the point where its relevance will vanish. It also limits the privacy of residents as it makes it easier for the government to monitor activity and everyday life. Making smart cities also raises concerns about the security of people presiding there. The more technology involved, the easier it is for people to hack into and locate residents, though hackers can easily locate targets with the sim card on the victim's phone so the vulnerability will be minimally increased. The worry that smaller economies will struggle to adapt to the fast-paced smart cities has been voiced by the government because building these cities calls for large investments and infrastructure and most of the said smaller places do not have the resources to adopt such technology.

3.Even though there are many valid concerns raised about smart cities, the benefits outweigh the costs as the US is interested in advancing and continuing to be a powerhouse on the world stage.


Justification and Summary:

The US needs to work towards creating more sustainable smart cities. We need to use city gardens that can sustain our society to the best of our abilities. The US is committed to the advancements of technology in less developed areas that do not have the same access to technology. The US should put forth efforts to bring smart cities to areas because it would increase the national economic growth and provide resources to more people that would improve quality of life. The US should implement gardens and sustainable farming to increase yield and health throughout the country. The US should encourage technological growth in advanced cities, such as Silicon Valley, and not limit their development to further our national power. The US should also create more smart focused cities to facilitate growth in other regions of the country. However, it is necessary to protect wildlife and human rights as smart cities develop and spread.
